## How I built the Arcade Game

I manipulated the DOM with Vanilla JS, and also have altered part of the HTML and the style of the game. Game engin was provided to me.

- created the player class.
- Created multiple enemies to make the game more fun
- created a counter to count the number of moves made by player and timer to know the duration of a play.
- create a pop-up when player wins/lose the game.
